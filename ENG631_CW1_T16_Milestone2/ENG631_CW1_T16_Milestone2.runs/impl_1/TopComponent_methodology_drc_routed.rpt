LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell compResetDebouncer/signalCounter[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) compBinaryDisplay/sigDataScroll_reg/CLR, compClock1Hz/clockOut_reg/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[0]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[10]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[11]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[12]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[13]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[14]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[15]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[16]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[17]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[18]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[19]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[1]/CLR, compClock1Hz/counter_reg[20]/CLR (the first 15 of 105 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock compClockManager/inst/in100mhz is defined downstream of clock C100Mhz_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
